The two chemicals are discussed together because aldrin readily changes into dieldrin once it enters either the environment or your body. From the 1950s until 1970, aldrin and dieldrin entered the environment when farmers used these compounds to kill pests on crops and when exterminators used them to kill termites. Aldrin and dieldrin are still present in the environment from these past uses. Symptoms of aldrin and dieldrin poisoning have been seen in people who were exposed to very large amounts of these pesticides during their manufacture. Most of these people experienced convulsions or other nervous system effects, and some had kidney damage. Health effects in people exposed to smaller amounts of aldrin or dieldrin occur because levels of the chemicals build up in the body over time. Exposure to moderate levels of aldrin or dieldrin for a long time causes headaches, dizziness, irritability, vomiting, or uncontrollable muscle movements. We do not know whether aldrin or dieldrin affects the ability of people to fight diseases, or causes birth defects or cancer in people.")

The health effects of the different barium compounds depend on how well the compound dissolves in water or in the stomach contents. Barium has been found to potentially cause gastrointestinal disturbances and muscular weakness when people are exposed to it at levels above the EPA drinking water standards for relatively short periods of time. Some people who eat or drink amounts of barium above background levels found in food and water for a short period may experience vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, difficulties in breathing, increased or decreased blood pressure, numbness around the face, and muscle weakness. Barium compounds that do not dissolve well, such as barium sulfate, are not generally harmful.

In 1988, when the EPA canceled chlordane's use for controlling termites, all approved use of chlordane in the United States stopped. Everyone in the United States has been exposed to low levels of chlordane. Today, people receive the highest exposure to chlordane from living in homes that were treated with chlordane for termites. Chlordane may be found in the air in these homes for many years after treatment. Most health effects in humans that may be linked to chlordane exposure are on the nervous system, the digestive system, and the liver. These effects were seen mostly in people who swallowed chlordane mixtures. It is not known whether chlordane will cause cancer in humans after long-term exposure.

Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets. Copper compounds are commonly used in agriculture to treat plant diseases like mildew, for water treatment and, as preservatives for wood, leather, and fabrics. Copper is released into the environment by mining, farming, and manufacturing operations and through waste water releases into rivers and lakes. Copper is also released from natural sources, like volcanoes, windblown dusts, decaying vegetation, and forest fires. Breathing high levels of copper can cause irritation of your nose and throat. Ingesting high levels of copper can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Very-high doses of copper can cause damage to your liver and kidneys, and can even cause death. The most likely place to be exposed to copper is through drinking water, especially if your water is corrosive and you have copper pipes in your house. The best way to lower the level of copper in your drinking water is to let the water run for at least 15 seconds first thing in the morning before drinking or using it.

You may be exposed by breathing contaminated air or drinking contaminated water near waste sites and landfills that may contain higher levels of these chemicals, or by eating contaminated imported foods from countries that still allow the use of DDT to control pests. DDT affects the nervous system. People who accidentally swallowed large amounts of DDT became excitable and had tremors and seizures. These effects went away after the exposure stopped. A study in humans showed that women who had high amounts of a form of DDE in their breast milk were unable to breast feed their babies for as long as women who had little DDE in the breast milk. Another study in humans showed that women who had high amounts of DDE in breast milk had an increased chance of having premature babies.

The effects of lead are the same whether it enters the body through breathing or swallowing. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system, both in adults and children. Long-term exposure of adults can result in decreased performance in some tests that measure functions of the nervous system. It may also cause weakness in fingers, wrists, or ankles. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure, particularly in middle-aged and older people and can cause anemia. Exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has determined that vinyl chloride is a known carcinogen. Studies in workers who have breathed vinyl chloride over many years showed an increased risk of liver, brain, lung cancer, and some cancers of the blood have also been observed in workers. Animal studies also suggest that infants and young children might be more susceptible than adults to vinyl chloride-induced cancer.")

Some is released into the environment by natural processes, but most comes from human activities like mining, steel production, coal burning, and burning of waste. Exposure to high levels of zinc occurs mostly from eating food, drinking water, or breathing workplace air that is contaminated. Zinc is an essential element in our diet; low levels of zinc are essential for maintaining good health. Exposure to large amounts of zinc can be harmful. It can cause stomach cramps, anemia, and changes in cholesterol levels. Harmful effects generally begin at levels 10-15 times higher than the amount needed for good health. Based on incomplete information from human and animal studies, the EPA has determined that zinc is not classifiable as to its human carcinogenicity.")
