PAHs are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. There are more than 100 different PAHs. PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes. PAHs can be harmful to your health under some circumstances. Studies of people show that individuals exposed by breathing or skin contact for long periods to mixtures that contain PAHs and other compounds can develop cancer.")

Most acetone produced is used to make other chemicals that make plastics, fibers, and drugs. Acetone is also used to dissolve other substances. Most people can smell acetone in the air at 100 to 140 ppm; that means you will probably smell acetone before you feel effects like headache and confusion. Levels of acetone in air in rural areas and in cities (less than 8 ppb) are generally lower than this.")

They are chemicals that are made in the laboratory and do not occur naturally in the environment.  The two chemicals are discussed together because aldrin readily changes into dieldrin once it enters either the environment or your body. From the 1950s until 1970, aldrin and dieldrin entered the environment when farmers used these compounds to kill pests on crops and when exterminators used them to kill termites. Aldrin and dieldrin are still present in the environment from these past uses. Symptoms of aldrin and dieldrin poisoning have been seen in people who were exposed to very large amounts of these pesticides during their manufacture. Most of these people experienced convulsions or other nervous system effects, and some had kidney damage. Health effects in people exposed to smaller amounts of aldrin or dieldrin occur because levels of the chemicals build up in the body over time. Exposure to moderate levels of aldrin or dieldrin for a long time causes headaches, dizziness, irritability, vomiting, or uncontrollable muscle movements. We do not know whether aldrin or dieldrin affects the ability of people to fight diseases, or causes birth defects or cancer in people.")

If you work in a place that makes products like dyes, varnishes, herbicides, and explosives, you may be exposed to aniline. People living near uncontrolled hazardous waste sites may be exposed to higher than normal levels of aniline. Aniline has also been detected in tobacco smoke, so people who smoke or breath in second-hand smoke may also be exposed to aniline. Rats that ate food contaminated with aniline for life developed cancer of the spleen. Children should avoid playing in soils near uncontrolled hazardous waste sites where aniline may have been discarded. ")

Antimony oxide is added to textiles and plastics to prevent them from catching fire. In polluted areas containing high levels of antimony, it may be found in the air, water, and soil. Exposure to antimony at high levels can result in a variety of adverse health effects. Breathing high levels for a long time can irritate your eyes and lungs and can cause heart and lung problems, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach ulcers. We don't know whether antimony will cause cancer in people. Antimony can have beneficial effects when used for medical reasons. It has been used as a medicine to treat people infected with parasites.")

Organic arsenic compounds are used as pesticides, primarily on cotton fields and orchards. Inorganic arsenic compounds are mainly used to preserve wood. Several studies have shown that ingestion of inorganic arsenic can increase the risk of skin cancer and cancer in the liver, bladder, and lungs. Inhalation of inorganic arsenic can cause increased risk of lung cancer. There is some evidence that long-term exposure to arsenic in children may result in lower IQ scores. There is also some evidence that exposure to arsenic in the womb and early childhood may increase mortality in young adults. There is some evidence that inhaled or ingested arsenic can injure pregnant women or their unborn babies, although the studies are not definitive.")

They are also used to make paint, bricks, ceramics, glass, and rubber. The health effects of the different barium compounds depend on how well the compound dissolves in water or in the stomach contents. Barium has been found to potentially cause gastrointestinal disturbances and muscular weakness when people are exposed to it at levels above the EPA drinking water standards for relatively short periods of time. Some people who eat or drink amounts of barium above background levels found in food and water for a short period may experience vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, difficulties in breathing, increased or decreased blood pressure, numbness around the face, and muscle weakness. Barium compounds that do not dissolve well, such as barium sulfate, are not generally harmful. The EPA has determined that barium is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans following ingestion and that there is insufficient information to determine whether it will be carcinogenic to humans following inhalation exposure.")
